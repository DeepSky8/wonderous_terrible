Losing supplies, crew members, failing to prevent something from happening to a vulnerable population, failing to prevent political consequences---these are all reasonable stakes. Destroying your players' crew and their ship and their homeworld and eradicating their species, unless this is something your group actively wants, probably shouldn't be on the table.`
